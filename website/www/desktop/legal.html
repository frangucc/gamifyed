We regularly collect Non-Personal Information from users of the Site. "Non-Personal Information" is information that does not itself identify you personally, but includes your email address, the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Site. We may automatically (i.e., not via registration) collect Non-Personal Information when you connect to or use the Site. We may store, compile, internally publish, promote, report this information, but CTI will not lease, sell, or otherwise disclose Non-Personal Information to third parties. We may use this information in the future to notify you of promotions, updates and other offers. We also reserve the right to collect "Personal Information," which, generally speaking, is information that identifies you individually, such as your name and contact information. We will only collect Personal Information about you that you provide to us voluntarily through interactive features of the Site. If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it to us. When you do provide us with Personal Information, we may store and evaluate that information to better understand your needs and how we can better serve you, and we may use that information to contact you. We do not now and do not intend to sell, lease, or market Personal Information about you to third parties. However, CTI may disclose Personal Information about you in the following cases: (i) to comply with a subpoena, search warrant, court order or other legal requirement; or (ii) in the event that CTI has reason to believe that disclosing Personal Information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who, intentionally or unintentionally, may be causing injury or harm to the Site, its users, or other persons or violating the Site's Terms of Use.</p><h5><strong>Links To or From Another Website</strong></h5><p>This Site may contain links to other websites operated by CTI, affiliates of CTI, or third parties (such as sales and distribution partners).

Personal Information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to CTI.</p><h5><strong>Third-party Agents</strong></h5><p>We occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, such as marketing, analytics, advertising, fulfillment, shipping or stocking orders, providing customer service, fraud protection, and others.
