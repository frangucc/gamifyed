### This is the Gamifyed Developer Motherload
#### This will get thinned out a lot when we push to production

# TO BEGIN

##### From your node:

1. cd into [/gamifyed-cli/](/gamifyed-cli/) and run: 
> chmod u+x cli-definitions.sh
2. run: 
> alias gamifyed="/gamifyed/gamifyed-cli/cli-definitions.sh"
3. run: 
> gamifyed

#### These actions will tell your terminal to run the gamifyed C++ main entry program, which will trigger the workflow-router, which triggers a bunch of system checks, updates the users latest state, looks at the connection, populates some variables then runs game, taking you to where you left off.
