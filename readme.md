# This is the Gamifyed Motherload
### Please follow these conventions

- Create a readme.md for each new folder and describe the folder or goals of the folder
- Make you're MD file look like everyone elses in terms of Markdown
- Document what you do in your source code at all times
- Always document how to get your project up and running, list any dependencies and ensure it's base scripted
- Never expect anyone to do anything expect for execut bash.sh at the root of each folder - that will ensure we have documented the proper instructions

### Make lot's of small commits when you work on anything programmatic or research wise
### Make sure your commits are descriptive in github
### Try and keep this all organized and neat
